    "Housekeeping Note: After the update of SeekScraper.py to search for jobs based on category rather than skill (e.g. 'data analyst' rather than 'python') and search multiple categories, I have changed the file names to differentiate between the original and updated dataset. The original datasets will be replaced with 'Job Details v1.csv' and 'Job Requirements v1.csv' to allow this code to still run as originally intended. The new datasets (used in later sections) will remain named 'Job Details.csv' and 'Job Requirements.csv'.\n",

    "It is important to use set datasets for this analysis as the datasets generated by the scraper will change frequently as jobs are added and removed from the website. Additionally, scraping the datasets is quite a time-consuming process so it's best to save the results as an external file and work from there rather than re-scraping the data each time. Overall, this approach is more consistent and efficient when performing a demonstration or exploratory analysis, as I have below."

Additionally, I don't have any post-graduate qualifications or management experience, so I'll probably rule out any manager/team lead roles or roles requesting a Masters or PhD. Finally, with only two years' experience, I'm firmly in the Junior/Intermediate range, and should probably filter out any \"Senior\" roles."
